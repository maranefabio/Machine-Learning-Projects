# Description - Telecommunications company customer churn

This project uses <b>Supervised Machine Learning</b> algorithms to <b>predict customer churn</b> for a hypothetical telecommunications company.
Foremost, the data is retrieved from a CSV file available in <i>Kaggle</i>. Then, the data is <b>balanced, labeled, separated and applied into 9 different algorithms</b> - one of them used as a baseline. Then, the results are gathered and for further comparison. The algorithms used belongs to the modules <i>Scikit-Learn and XGBoost</i>:
- Logistic Regression (baseline);
- Support Vector Classifier;
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Both Euclidean and Chebyshev metrics);
- Gaussian and Bernoulli Na√Øve-Bayes Classifier;
- Decision Tree Classifier;
- Random Forest Classifier;
- XGBoost Classifier.
